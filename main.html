        <p>
	    I started my research journey as an undergraduate intern. Initially, I worked on a project predicting whether neutrinos from external sources could be observed at KNO. After that, I moved on to modeling galaxy cluster environments through plasma particle simulations and explored the theoretical explanations for related observational phenomena. I also participated in a project analyzing MWA observational data. Currently, I'm involved in the SKA project, where I'm applying deep learning to radio observation data, and I'm also contributing to the development of a cloud data center for next-generation large telescopes. Through these projects, I've developed a strong interest in astronomy, data science, AI, and cloud technologies, and Iâ€™m actively studying to deepen my knowledge in these areas.
