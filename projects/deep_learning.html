        <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;Deep learning is being introduced across all research fields, yielding significant results. As an attempt, this project used deep learning to remove celestial signals for early universe signal observation. The background was simulated, and celestial objects were randomly added to create training sets. The upscaling process involved bicubic interpolation, and data augmentation was achieved through rotation and translation, providing an understanding of various algorithms for image data processing. Additionally, using Python's TensorFlow package, the project applied a u-NET structure based on an autoencoder model to extract only the background from 3D cubes containing celestial bodies. This experience facilitates active participation in deep learning tasks in data roles.</p>
