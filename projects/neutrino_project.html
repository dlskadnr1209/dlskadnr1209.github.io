        <h1>Neutrino Project</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project explores the observability of neutrinos using data from overseas telescopes through mathematical modeling. The data, primarily received in Excel format, is processed using Python's pandas package to classify and organize signals from celestial bodies. After mathematically modeling the process of neutrino generation, applying this to all overseas telescope data yields predicted neutrino signals. By investigating the most likely sources and applying the expected structure of Korea's next-generation neutrino telescope, the observability can be statistically predicted. The conclusion was that it is challenging to observe neutrinos from celestial bodies with Korea's next-generation neutrino telescope. The experience with Python and pandas laid a strong foundation for future data analysis processes.</p>
