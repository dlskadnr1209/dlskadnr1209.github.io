        <h1>Data Processing System</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;With Korea participating in the next-generation large radio telescope project, there was a need to build a system to store massive amounts of data and make it accessible for Korean researchers. I had the opportunity to assist in the initial stages of this system's construction, where I learned a lot about Docker and containers through the Korea Institute of Information Technology. As part of the project, I created Docker containers for the software used by observational researchers and tested deployment. In addition, I worked hands-on with Kubernetes and OpenStack, learning how to manage and deploy large-scale infrastructure. Even though my main role was focused on data, I believe itâ€™s essential to keep learning and adapting to new IT technologies as the landscape evolves. This experience will definitely be valuable for future collaborations with other institutions and in different roles.</p>

        <h2>Comment</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;Through this project, I obtained the Certified SAFe 6 Practitioner certification. Although it expired on May 28, 2024, it provided me with valuable insights into Agile processes and effective team collaboration methods. Still, I'm a member of Korea SRC Team.</p>
