        <h1>Data Processing System</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;With Korea's participation as a member nation in the next-generation large radio telescope project, it became necessary to build a system to store large amounts of data and facilitate the use of Korean researchers. I had the opportunity to assist in the initial construction of the system, learning extensively about Docker and containers from the Korea Institute of Information Technology. The project involved creating Docker containers for the software used by observational researchers and testing deployment. Despite my data role, I believe it is crucial to continuously learn and adopt new IT technologies in the evolving IT landscape. My experience will be valuable for collaboration with other institutions and roles.</p>
