        <h1>Bitcoin Trading</h1>
        <p>This is a project conducted independently from research projects. In a stock club, I created and tested trading strategies based on past data, analyzing results and adjusting parameters to improve outcomes. Although the project achieved a 5% profit over a week, it was discontinued due to the inability to cope with rapid market changes caused by computer performance and exchange policies. This project demonstrated the potential of data to achieve significant results.</p>
