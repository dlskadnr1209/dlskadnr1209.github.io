	<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;This is a project I conducted independently, where I used an API to pull historical data and create various trading strategies. I analyzed the results and adjusted parameters to improve performance. While the project achieved a 5% profit over the course of a week, I had to discontinue it due to challenges in handling rapid market changes caused by computer performance and exchange policies. Still, this project showed me the potential of data to achieve significant results.</p>

	<h2>Comment</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;Once the trading strategy is more fully developed, we plan to restart this project with renewed vigor. </p>
