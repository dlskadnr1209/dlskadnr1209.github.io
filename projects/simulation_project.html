        <h1>Simulation Project</h1>
        <p>This project aims to simulate astrophysical environments to explain observations. Handling massive datasets with billions of particles requires extensive data processing. All code is written in Fortran and executed on Linux servers. Unlike Python, which has many computational packages, Fortran requires explicitly writing all mathematical expressions. This process enabled the implementation of various partial differential equations concerning space and time. The use of parallelized code for efficient data handling also provided an understanding of the advantages of parallelization, facilitating its use in current projects. This experience allowed for the efficient handling and analysis of terabytes of data and the design of analytical codes for efficient data processing.</p>
